# Self-Hosting Loopr

Follow these steps to deploy Loopr on your own infrastructure using Docker.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Domain name (optional, for production deployment)

## Quick Start

**Step 1:** Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AnishSarkar22/Loopr.git
cd Loopr
```

**Step 2:** Environment Configuration

Copy the environment template and configure your settings:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

- Set your domain name in `_APP_DOMAIN` if in production
- Configure database credentials
- Set up SMTP settings for email notifications (Must do)
- Generate secure API key within appwrite dashboard after self hosting (Must do)

**Step 3:** Launch the Application

Start all services using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will automatically:

- Build the Loopr application container
- Start Appwrite backend services
- Initialize MariaDB database
- Configure Redis for caching
- Set up Traefik reverse proxy

**Step 4:** Initial Setup

Access the Appwrite console at `http://your-domain/console` to:

- Create your first admin account
- Set up the project name and project ID as `loopr-project`
- Configure authentication settings

**Step 5:** Create an API key in the settings and put it in `APPWRITE_API_KEY` in `.env` file and again run `docker-compose up -d`

**Step 6:** Enter the Loopr App Container

```
docker exec -it loopr-app sh
```

**Step 7:** Log in to Appwrite CLI

- For localhost deployments, use:
```
appwrite login --endpoint http://appwrite/v1
```

- For production deployments, use:
```
appwrite login appwrite login --endpoint https://<your-appwrite-domain.com>/v1
```

**Step 8:** Authenticate

```
appwrite login
```
Follow the CLI prompts to complete authentication.

**Step 9:** Deploy Appwrite Functions

Push all Appwrite functions and configurations:
```
appwrite push all --all --force
```

**Step 10:** Configure Global Variables in Appwrite

Use the `.env.dist` file as a reference and fill in all required global variables in your Appwrite project's settings. Make sure each environment variable needed by Loopr is set correctly in Appwrite.

**Step 11:** Access Loopr

Navigate to `http://loopr.your-domain` to access the Loopr dashboard and begin monitoring your URLs.

## Production Deployment 

### SSL/TLS Configuration

For production deployments, configure SSL certificates:

- Update `_APP_OPTIONS_FORCE_HTTPS=enabled` in your environment
- Ensure your domain DNS points to your server
- Traefik will automatically handle Let's Encrypt certificate generation

### Resource Optimization

Adjust the following environment variables based on your server capacity:

- `_APP_WORKER_PER_CORE` - Worker processes per CPU core
- `BATCH_SIZE` - Number of URLs processed per batch
- `PARALLEL_CHUNK_SIZE` - Concurrent monitoring operations
- `MAX_LOGS_PER_URL` - Log retention per monitored URL

### Scaling Considerations

For high-volume monitoring:

- Increase database connection limits
- Configure multiple worker nodes using `NODE_POOL_SIZE`
- Adjust batch sizes and processing intervals
- Consider horizontal scaling with multiple Loopr instances
